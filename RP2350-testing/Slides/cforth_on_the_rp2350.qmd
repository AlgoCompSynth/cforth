# A (Welcome) Surprise in the (e)Mail

## August 8 - from Pimoroni

## The announcement

## The partners

## The pre-orders

# Interlude While I Read a Bunch of Manuals and Download a Bunch of Software

## Getting Started with C/C++

## Getting Started with Python

# The SparkFun Boards Arrive!

## Does Python work?

## But wait! What about Forth?

## If only someone had written a portable Forth that I could "just compile"

# Enter `cforth`

## Originally written by Mitch Bradley as boot firmware for Sun Workstations

## Later ported to the boot firmware of the One Laptop Per Child

## Current incarnation is in C and designed for porting to
multiple embedded systems using PlatformIO

# OK, what's PlatformIO?
